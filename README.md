# The Story So Far
Thousands of years into the future an infection has ravaged the world and destroyed humanity. This infection caused humans to gain both size and immeasurable strength, leaving them in a permanent state of rage, attacking any moving thing in sight -that isn't infected. They then disappear, withdrawing to who knows where.

At first, the humans fought back before being overwhelmed. The sheer strength of the Infected being far too much for foot soldiers and conventional war machines to cope with. In a last ditch attempt, humans started to build Mech Suits which they would pilot to effectively fight off the Infected. 

This worked..... for a while. 

Eventually the Infection overwhelmed the humans. It could reproduce faster than they could stop it. It even started to seep into the Mech machinery, infecting the very pilots who controlled them.

Then, the end of the human race.

Where did the virus come from?
No one knows.

Most animals however seem to have an immunity to the virus and after several hundred years of exposure to it, have gained a kind of intelligence and dexterity, more so than they had ever experienced prior. They have built settlements, similar in style to early human towns. They have societies and colonies, trade routes and skirmishes, leaders and economies. 

The animals salvaged the Mech suits for themselves; adapting them for their tiny bodies. The Infected still exist - they don't seem to age, their lives extended by some warped mutation, and they still reap havoc across the planet. 

The Mechs are the last line of defence...
